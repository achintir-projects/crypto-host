    "destination_address": "0x728833c50Bd9C41A574e58eE2713Cbb9a4e7aeC2"
}'

2. PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT (Ethereum Mainnet)
------------------------------------------
curl -X POST https://ortenberg-crypto-host.onrender.com/api/v2/broadcast/deposit \
-H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_ortenberg_client_001" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \

}'

IMPORTANT NOTES
--------------
1. Transaction Value: $50,000 (22.73 ETH at $2,200/ETH)
2. The "sender" field must be filled with the client's wallet address
3. Test vs Production is determined by:
   - Authorization token (sk_test_* vs sk_live_*)
   - Master wallet address (test vs production)
4. Always verify addresses and amounts before executing
5. Monitor transaction status using the returned process_id

Transaction Details
-----------------
- Nonce: Automatically managed by the system
- Gas Price: Dynamically calculated for optimal confirmation
- Gas Limit: Set to standard ETH transfer value
- Chain ID: Automatically set based on environment

Security Reminders
----------------
- Never share API keys
- Double-check destination addresses
- Verify authorization token matches intended environment (test/production)
- Confirm gas fees before broadcasting
- Keep private keys secure

Status Checking
-------------
After executing either command, you'll receive a process_id. Use it to check status:

TEST:
curl -X GET https://ortenberg-crypto-host.onrender.com/api/v2/usdt/status/{process_id} \
-H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_ortenberg_client_001"

PRODUCTION:
curl -X GET https://ortenberg-crypto-host.onrender.com/api/v2/usdt/status/{process_id} \
-H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_ortenberg_client_001"

Environment Verification
----------------------
Before executing transactions, verify you're using:
1. Test Environment:
   - Authorization: sk_test_ortenberg_client_001
   - Master Wallet: 0x728833c50Bd9C41A574e58eE2713Cbb9a4e7aeC2
   - Network: Sepolia Testnet

2. Production Environment:
   - Authorization: sk_live_ortenberg_client_001
   - Master Wallet: 0x10ead6370820315F6d5a517c2166cBa4a564216b
   - Network: Ethereum Mainnet

⚠️ CRITICAL: VERIFY ADDRESSES
----------------------------
Production Master Wallet: 0x10ead6370820315F6d5a517c2166cBa4a564216b
- Double-check this address before any production transactions
- Verify on Etherscan before proceeding
- Any mistakes in the address cannot be reversed

Technical Notes
-------------
1. Nonce Management:
   - The system automatically handles nonce calculation
   - This ensures proper transaction ordering
   - No manual nonce specification is required
   - Prevents double-spending and transaction conflicts

2. Transaction Processing:
   - Each transaction is queued and processed sequentially
   - System monitors for confirmations
   - Status updates available via the status endpoint
   - Automatic gas price optimization for network conditions
